# Contributor's and Community's Code of Conduct

## What we want

The answer is simple. We want to help people.  

This community should always be about helping eachother.  
No discrimination, no matter what it is based on will be accepted.

## Contributor's role

The contributor's pushing code to the repositories are obligated to add neutral code/comments/variable names/function names/commits.

Any offensive naming quoted above spotted by either another contributor or a community member in:  
- an actual commit OR
- past commit OR
- in a pull request by a COALAs Member

can and will be held against you, and according to the conditions and terms down below, your sanction will be given.

Code is neutral and meant to ease functions by automating them, not stigmatise categories or communities.  
(A Contributor report template will be provided in the issues section of the problematic repository)

## Community's role

This community is not a forum, but a github page about a specific project.  
Be careful to how you speak and to how you speak.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
  
## Sanctions
### Enforcement
  
In order to help us moderate our projects, please use the issues template created to help us.
If someone misbehaves in a discussion, please contact @COALA-sftwr/team78.

### Warn

When reported for discussion/community misbehaving, you will be given warns.    
Warns dont mean anything really important, they do not change your ability to talk,  
participate or read code.

If you are to be given 2 warns and misbehave again, you will have other consequences.

### Other consequences

Ban.

If a user is to be given 3 warns, he will be banned from the github page.   
**⚠️The 3 warns are not applied for contribution misbehaviour, any of the offensive code warns will be counted as 2.⚠️**

To report for abusive banning you can join the discord and submit a ticket, it will then be reviewed.   
According to your ticket and the reason you are ban, the sanction can be lifter or not.
