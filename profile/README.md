## Who are we ?
### Me
Well first, I will present myself - I, who gave my name to this "organization" -

My name is Albert Andrei Cosoreanu. I am an IT student who wants to help as many people as he can, doing as much as he can, for now just making software projects.  
Thus the name ***CO***soreanu***AL***bert***A***ndrei ***s***oftwares

I'm a guy who loves a lot of things! Learning new things, statistics, coding or plastic model kits are some of my favorite stuffs,  
but one thing i also love is sharing and participating in a community, this is why most of the projects you will see on this page will be open source.

### The teams

The other members of COALAs official teams (@COALA-sftwr/team78 is the only one for now) are either friends, or school classmates that I really enjoy talking with and share the same vision about programming.

They are all talented people, some really talented, but most importantly they are kind people, so be kind to them when talking with them too ! (except if you ever see TheBot78, bully him as much as you can 😆)

### You (😲?!)

Yes, You !  
I dont know you, not personally at least. 
What I know is that everyone's help can improve on my projects.

If you feel like participating, you are welcome !

What do you mean, you don't know how to code ? Who cares ? Just do a feature request or warn us about a bug you've experienced. 
To know more about this tho, read the following part.

## Our projects

I plan on creating a large suite of softwares, including a web browser, a tchat client, IDE's and an office suite.    
Here are the actual working repositories:
- [Monkey Model Kits](https://github.com/COALA-sftwr/monkey-model-kit)

## How to participate ?
### Contributing to code

In order to contribute to code, there are just a few steps.

First, you need to (obviously) write code, but code that is clear, easy to read and understand.  
For now we did not chose an official formatting for functions/variables but follow with what has already been done on the project  
(It's the easiest way not to mess up things😜)

### Concerning the commits, we have set a special norm:

{type}[scope]: Modifications in a nutshell

Where the {type} defines the kind of changes made and the [scope] defines the softwares functions it affects.

###### For more informations, check-out [COMMITS.md](https://github.com/COALA-sftwr/.github/blob/main/profile/COMMITS.md) 

### Contributing in the community

If you enjoy our work, the best way you can help is by sharing it with friends and people you feel might be interested in our work.

Another way of helping is by talking with us, and the rest of the people who -just like you- enjoy our apps and want to share it. 
For this, all you need is to talk in the discussion channels, join us on our social medias (when we'll have some) or send bug reports or feature requests !  
(Bug report and Feature request templates will be here to help you !)

###### Any misbehaviour should be reported, see [the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/COALA-sftwr/.github/blob/main/profile/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more informations.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
